Space Truckin'
==============

This is roughly a clone of the old Space Taxi program.
You drive a box truck around in space, making deliveries.

This is written partly so that I have a project to learn Elm,
and partly because I loved Space Taxi so much, I want to play more games like it.


TODO
----

* Get truck to move left and right, per key presses.
* Get truck to turn left and right.
* Get truck to move up and down, per key presses.
* Add gravity.
* Add landing pads for the truck to land on.
* Add a route for the truck to follow (series of landing pads).
* Add objects for the truck to crash into.
* Add a series of screens.
    * Each will have different landing pads, objects, and routes.
* Customize game-play of each screen.
    * Different gravity possibly.
